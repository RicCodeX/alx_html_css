///////////////////////////////////////////////HTML///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images.
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation language created to style the appearance of content—using, for example, fonts or colors.
The two languages—HTML and CSS—are independent of one another and should remain that way. 
CSS should not be written inside of an HTML document and vice versa. As a rule, HTML will always represent content, and CSS will always represent the appearance of that content.

Elements(<a>, <h1>, <p>), tags(<a>...</a>, <h1>...</h1>, <p>...</p>), and attributes(href="" in <a href="http://shayhowe.com/">Shay Howe</a>, id="...", src="...", class="...") are the major HTML terms

///////////////////////////////////////////////CSS///////////////////////////////////////////////

The most common CSS terms are selectors, properties, values.

A selector designates exactly which element or elements within our HTML to target and apply styles 
(such as color, size, and position) to e.g p { ... } which argets all paragraph element in the html

Property determines the styles that will be applied to that element. Property names fall after a selector, 
within the curly brackets, {}, and immediately preceding a colon, :. There are numerous properties we can use, 
such as background, color, font-size, height, and width, and new properties are often added. 
e.g p {
  color: ...;
  font-size: ...;
} to all the paragraphs in the html
